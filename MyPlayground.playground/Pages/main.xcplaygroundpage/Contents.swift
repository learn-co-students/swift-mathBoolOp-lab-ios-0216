/*: Question 1
### 1. Add two Doubles
*/
// write your code here
 let numberOne = 2.5
let numberTwo = 2.5

numberOne + numberTwo

/*: Question 2
### 2. Add an Int to a Double
*/
// write your code here

//let a = 1
//let b = 2.5
//
//let productOfAAndB = a + Int(b)




/*: Question 3
### 3. Compare two Ints for equality
*/
// write your code here
 3 == 3

/*: Question 4
### 4. Compare two Doubles for equality
*/
// write your code here

2.5 == 2.5

/*: Question 5
### 5. Compare an Int and a Double equality
*/
// write your code here

let x = 1
let y = 2.5

x == Int(y)

/*: Question 6
### 6. Compare 3 and 3.5 for equality (NB what do you have to be mindful of in this case?)
*/
// write your code here
3 <= Int(3.5)



/*: Question 7
### 7. Compare 3 and 3.5 for equality and 6.1 and 7 for inequality
*/
// write your code here

3 <= Int(3.5)

Int(6.1) <= 7

/*: Question 8
### 8. Write code expressing "if a less than b or x is greater than or equal to y"
*/
// write your code here
let a = 1
let b = 2
let x = 5
let y = 10

a < b
x >= y

### 9. Write a function which returns the sum of three Ints
*/
// write your code here


/*: Question 10
### 10. Write a function average_i which returns the average of three Ints as an Int
*/
// write your code here


/*: Question 11
### 11. Use the return value of that function in a boolean expression
*/
// write your code here


/*: Question 12
### 12. Write a function average_f which returns the average of three Ints as a Float
*/
// write your code here


/*: Question 13
### 13. Call average_f with values 1, 3, and 5 and test if the result equals 3.0
*/
// write your code here


/*: Question 14
### 14. Call average_i with values 1, 3, and 5 and test if the result is both greater than 1 and less than 5.
*/
// write your code here
